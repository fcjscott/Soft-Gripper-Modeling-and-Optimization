# Soft-Gripper-Modeling-and-Optimization
This app aims to provide intuitive strategies for pneumatic 2-D soft grippers to grasp different objects. The theory lies behind this application is called Discrete Elastic Rod (DER). The dimension of the model is selected from Softrobotics M2FR for demonstration purpose

This app can also run in automatic mode, adjusting its angle and positions, for different objects to maximize the efficiency of the gripper. The efficiency of the gripper is determined as inlet pressure per unit lifting force, which has a significant contribution for industrial usage. 

How to use:
1. Open GUI.app
2. Choose your object and enter your object size, weight and friction coefficient
3. Choose whether you want to run in automatic mode or manual mode. For manual mode, you need to adjust gripper angle, gripper position and finger position. Gripper angle is the open angle between the grippers, gripper position is the vertical position of the gripper head and finger spacing stands for the distance between the heads of two branches. For automatic mode, you don't need to enter these values.
